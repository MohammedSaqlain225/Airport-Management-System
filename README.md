# Airport-Management-System
The objective of this project is to design and implement airport management with
user interface using oracle. It includes details of passenger with fields such as name ,
address, phone number and unique id of passenger details which will be stored in
database for verification. Reservation details helps in reserving seats for the passenger
with other details such as date, flight number. If the user needs to cancel the
reservation he can do cancellation by providing details to the administrator. Flight
details have to be maintained including flight number, code, source and destination
etc. Hence, depending on airline, source, destination, journey date and most
importantly class, which passenger chooses fare price of an air ticket is determined.
Every employee is identified by SSN. Every employee has an information such as
name, address, phone, age, sex, ssalary. Airport management system front end is
developed using html , php,css and back end is done using oracle by xampp (apache)
server.
